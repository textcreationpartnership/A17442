            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Obiection is of no force, becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Men did maintayne but ſome one or other Point againſt the Church, compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and interleaging in all the reſt with the Catholiks: But after, the moſt part of them relinquiſhing their former Errours, dyed Catholiks; and in regard of their ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before their deaths to the Church of Rome (and not otherwiſe) they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Catholiks. Secondly, I ſay, that whiles theſe former Men did perſiſt in their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:25767:13"/> Noueliſmes, during all that tyme, they were condemned by the Church of Rome for Heretiks; and therefore it cannot be vrged, that theſe Men were Papiſts, at that tyme of their diſſenting from the Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall Church; for by ſuch their Schiſme, they were cut off from the Catholike Church, and wholy reiected for members thereof. And I freely grant, that a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, or Papiſt (as we are opprobriouſly called) may become an Heretike, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertayning ſome Innouations; But then (I ſay) he ceaſeth to be a Catholike, or Papiſt.</p>
            <p>But the Caſe is far otherwiſe with the Proteſtants vrged in this following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. For firſt the Proteſtants heere produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced (being incomparably far greater in number, then the former named Sectaries) do not diſagree in one, or two, or three Points only of Proteſtancy among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; but they are diſtracted almoſt in all points of Proteſtancy. Againe, I ſay, the Proteſtants by me vrged, though recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally croſſing one another (contrary to the ſtate of <hi>Berengarius Eraſmus,</hi> and the reſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ſpecified) yet during he ſame time of maintayning their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradictory Opinions, do ſtill remayne Proteſtants; &amp; accordingly they are all promiſcuouſly acknowledged, as good Members of the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Church: So great is the diſparity betweene the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer vrged Authours by <hi>D.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25767:74"/> 
                  <hi>prima veritas,</hi> doth reueale all true points of Fayth. The ſecond; to wit, The <hi>Authority of the Church,</hi> is called <hi>Amuſsit, Regula, or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounder,</hi> becauſe it propoundeth to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, all ſuch points to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued, which God reuealed to the Church to be belieued. Now to applye this to our purpoſe: This <hi>Prima veritas reuelant,</hi> as alſo this <hi>Propounder</hi> do indifferently propound to the Members of the Church, all points of Fayth to be belieued, as well as any one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly point; and the Perſons to whom ſuch points of Fayth are reuealed, and propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be belieued, do through the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church belieue all points of Fayth, to be reuealed alike. Therefore ſeeing the former Proteſtants belieuing the former particular Catholike Articles, do belieue them, not through the Authority of the Church, propounding them to be belieued; for if they did belieue them, by force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, they would in like ſort belieue all other Catholike points; ſeeing all of them are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like reuealed by God to the Church, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like propounded by the Church to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to be belieued: Therefore from hence it followeth, that the former Proteſtants do belieue the foreſayd Catholike Points, only through the force of their owne priuate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which intertayneth them as points pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable and true. And thus the Cloſe of all is, that the ſaid Proteſtants do belieue, or rather giue aſſent vnto <hi>Truths, falſly,</hi> (ſo mans Gho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly Enemy, when he ſpeaketh the truth, he

The texts ſhalbe theſe: 1. <hi>The King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who only hath Immortality.</hi> 1. Timoth. c. 6. Now from this place one might ſeeme to argue, that ſince God alone is immortall, the ſoule of Man is not immortall, but dyeth with the body: an Atheiſticall blaſphemy. 2. <hi>He that striketh thee on the Cheeke, offer alſo the other; and him, that taketh away thy Cloake, forbid not to take thy Coate alſo.</hi> Luke 6. Which words of our Sauiour ſeeme to implye that we muſt offer vpon ſuch an occaſion, the other cheeke to be ſtrocken, and ſuffer our Coate to be taken away with our Cloake; And if we do not this we ſinne, ſince it is a ſinne, not to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the precept of Chriſt. 3. <hi>Call no man your Father vpon earth.

Luc.</hi> 14. Here the naked words ſound, that whereas in the ten Commandements we are taught to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour our Father and mother, as alſo obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to loue our wyues and friends; yet here the next way to ſerue Chriſt truly, is to hate our Parents, our Wyues, &amp; other our neareſt Friends. 5. <hi>Vanum est vobis ante lucem ſurgere;</hi> Pſalm. 126. <hi>It is but vayne for you, to ryſe before

All which are moſt true in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and intended ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt; yet they conuince, that the Scriptures are not of that facility and eaſines for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnderſtanding of them, as diuers Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants alledged towards the beginning of this Treatiſe (merely contrary to the more graue iudgments of other Proteſtants their brethren) do make ſhew to teach.</p>

            <p>WHEREAS in this former Treatiſe (I meane in the tenth Paragraph) we haue ſhewed, how moſt Proteſtants do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the ancient Fathers; exerciſing their fomy language in the eiuculation of moſt gaulfull words agaynſt them (though the ſayd Fathers be by other more moderate Proteſtants reſpected &amp; reuerenced:) Now heere in this ſhort Appendix I thinke it to be much conuenient; Firſt to ſhew the reaſon more particularly, why the Proteſtants do reſt diſaffected agaynſt the Fathers: It being (though aboue in part intimated) in that it is ackowledged by the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts themſelues that all the Articles of Catholike Religion, were with an Vniformity of Iudgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieued,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:25767:80"/> taught, and practiſed by the ſayd <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> in thoſe moſt pure tymes. Secondly, I will make it euident, euen with ſeuerall choaching Reaſons, why euery Chriſtian Man (ſolicitous of entertayning a true faith) ſhould prefer the ancient Fathers in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Scriptures (from whence they draw of theirs, and our Catholike fayth and Religion) before the different or contrary expoſitions of them, giuen by the Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Doctours. The diſcouery of which later Point ſhall reſt in ſetting down diuers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and auaylable <hi>Circumstances</hi> in behalf of the Fathers, but altogether preiudiciall and incompetent to the Proteſtants.

I could proue the like by the Confeſſions of the learned Proteſtants, in all other Articles, controuerted betweene vs and the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; But I truſt, that theſe former Articles (being of greateſt Moment) may ſerue in lieu of all the reſt, which are of leſſer Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>Only I thinke good to adioyne here this enſuing Animaduerſion. To wit, That whereas in the producing of the former Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> in behalfe of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Religion, all <hi>Fathers</hi> are not brought in, by the Confeſſion of the Proteſtants, to teach the ſaid Catholike Articles; Now the reaſon of this is, in that euery ancient <hi>Father</hi> did not wryte of euery particular Article of Catholike Religion; and conſequently ſuch could not be alledged by the Proteſtants confeſſions, in proofe of the Articles omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. Neuertheleſſe it vnauoidably followeth, by all true inference of Reaſon, that all other <hi>Fathers</hi> in ſuch particular points of Catholike Religion, as are omitted by the

                  </gap>ers;</hi> they then would haue beene written againſt, by ſome other more Orthodoxall Writers and <hi>Fathers,</hi> touching the ſaid points: As we ſee that certaine Errours in <hi>Origen, Tertullian,</hi> &amp; <hi>Cyprian</hi> (to omit the like Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in <hi>Donatus, Iouinian, Pelagius,</hi> and ſundry ſuch other Noueliſts) were inſtantly impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Auſtin, Ierome, Epiphanius, Theodoret</hi> &amp;c. But no ſuch writing was againſt the former confeſſed <hi>Fathers</hi> in this Treatiſe, for their houlding the foreſaid Catholike Points; Therefore it is certaine, that all other <hi>Fathers</hi> of the Primitiue Church did jointly teach, and belieue the ſaid Catholike doctrines, with the aboue confeſſed <hi>Fathers.</hi>

            <p>Againe, the alledged <hi>Fathers</hi> in this <hi>Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> were the chiefe Paſtours in God Church in thoſe dayes; in whom the Church of Chriſt was peculiarly and more markably perſonated. Therefore all other Inferiour Members of the Church, did agree with them in the beliefe of the ſaid Catholike Doctrines; or otherwiſe by their deniall of them they did ceaſe to be members of the ſaid Church of God: <hi>Cum</hi>

            <p>Now to deſcend to the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Part of this <hi>Appendix;</hi> which is touching the <hi>Compariſon</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:25767:90"/> made betweene the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctours and Wryters, for the fyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the intended ſenſe of the Holy Ghoſt, in the expoſition of the ſacred Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: In the conſideration of which point, I grant, I am finally moued to a iuſt and warrantable Anger; ſince the want thereof vpon ſo vrgent an occaſion, might well be reputed but ſtupidity, and an inſenſiblenes of the indignities and wrongs, offered to thoſe bleſſed and happy Saints. Therefore let the Reader pardon me, if I here ſharpen my Pen (which can hardly ſpend its inke, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a more worthy and noble ſubiect,) and if I become ſomewhat more luxuriant in defence of theſe Champions of Chriſt his Church; vpon whom diuers <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (as in the former Treatiſe is ſhewed) do euen ſhowre downe infinit words of reproach &amp; contumely, and do throwe vpon their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Memories, the durte, and filth of their owne moſt intemperate and gaulefull Language.</p>
            <p>But firſt, I thinke it conuenient, to take away the vulgar ſtumbling-Block, which moſt of our Aduerſaries haue layed betwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the Truth, and the eyes of the ignorant and credulous Proteſtant. Which is, as the Proteſtants moſt wrongfully (and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues conſciouſly) ſuggeſt; That ſeing the <hi>Scripture</hi> (as being the vndoubted Word of God) is to be aduanced before the Authority of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> they being but men: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Protestants</hi> (ſay they) relye only vpon

               </gap>her humane Authorities; Why then ſhould not the <hi>Scripture</hi> be pryzed aboue the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the ſaid <hi>Fathers?</hi> Now to diſpell and diſſipate this weake ſmoake from the Eyes of the Ignorant; I do auer this their anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were to be a mere <hi>Elench</hi> of Fallacy, called by the Logitians, <hi>Petitio Principij;</hi> ſince here it is falſly preſumed, that the Proteſtants do relye only vpon the true ſenſe of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Fathers do reiect the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Whereas indeed the Fathers with all Reuerence and honour do affect the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and moſt humbly ſubmit themſelues to it. And therefore the life and touch of the doubt in this point only conſiſteth: To wit, whether the Fathers (who buyld the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of their Fayth vpon the Scriptures) are to be preferred before the Proteſtants, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting the ſaid Scriptures in a contrary Senſe. And <hi>thus the Antitheſis, or oppoſition is here to be made, not betweene the Fathers and the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> (as our Aduerſaries do calumniouſly pretend) <hi>but betwene the Conſtructions, giuen by the Fathers of certayne Texts of holy Scripture, and the different, or contrary constructions of the ſayd Text, giuen by the Proteſtants</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The lyke ſubtility our aduerſaries (to wit, the <hi>Centuriſts, D. Whitaker, Illyricus,</hi> and others) do vſe, when the call Catholike do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, as they are maintained by vs, <hi>Idolatry, Hereſies, Blaſphemies</hi> &amp;c. thereby to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that the Papiſts are no members of Chriſts Church: which very doctrines, as

            <p>But to launce further in diſcourſing of the <hi>Compariſon,</hi> betweene the Fathers and the Proteſtants: For I hould it my honour to be their poore <hi>Aduocate</hi> vpon earth; and I hope, that in their <hi>Seraphicall,</hi> and burning Charity, they wilbe my <hi>Adocate</hi> in Heauen: and will vouchſafe to intercede to his Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Maieſty for the remiſſion of my infinite ſinnes and tranſgreſſions.

But to deſcend more particularly to the diſſecting of this point; I hould it moſt conducing, to preſent to the Readers Eye,

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:25767:93"/> And what in that Booke is deliuered in painting forth their wicked and irreligious courſes, is deliuered from the Writings only of other Proteſtants, their Brethren: ſo truly are verified of theſe Proteſtant Wryters, <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis</hi>

            <p>Furthermore, diuers learned Proteſtants of theſe dayes are ſo far from abandoning the temporall Benefis of the World, as that they commonly make their Religion, a Shoing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne to draw on ſome opulent, and great Eccleſiaſticall Liuing, or Parſonage; ſo they finally making a Steeple, yea two or three ſteeples ſometymes (of ſo great a ſwallow diuers of them are) and a Siſter in the Lord (thus coopling <hi>Pluto,</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> together) their very But, or Marke of all their Schola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall endeauours, or their ſupreme felicity in this World: So thrall and mancipated they are become to all tranſitory and fading Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectiues, and ſo breathleſly do they run in crye in the purſuite of them; Howſoeuer many of them, through their ſophiſticall Comportment, and dooble-faced Actions, ſeeme externally to be wholy ſpiritualized, and euen to feed only vpon the Goſpell.</p>

            <p n="5">5. Another ouerballancing <hi>Circumstance</hi> reſulteth, from the different Conditions of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and of the <hi>Protestants,</hi> touching the preaching of their ſeuerall doctrines in Fayth. The <hi>Fathers</hi> interpreted the Holy Scriptures in confirmation of our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Fayth, when as no other Fayth was knowne, and many ages before <hi>Protestancy</hi> was euer dreamed of: And therefore what they did write, or teach out of the Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, they did it in an Aziſme and purity of Conſcience; not being foreſtalled with any Preiudice of Iudgment, or inuited thereto by any humane or temporary Motiues; the moſt dangerous Sands, vpon which many Schollars do ſuffer ſhipwrack. Now the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> (I meane chiefly many Proteſtant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters throghout Chriſtendome) euen from the firſt tyme that <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> began to get on wing, do proſecute their Fayth with a moſt ſtrong bent of Endeuour, becauſe their temporall ſtates (as aboue is intimated) are ſo imbarked therein, as that an vtter extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25767:95"/> of <hi>Proteſtancy</hi> would inſtantly threaten all mendicity, and ruine to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours thereof: So fully are their temporall ſtates ingaged in their owne Religion.</p>
            <p>Therefore no wonder it is, if moſt <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Doctours (as in likelyhood they do) do thus ſyllogize and diſpute in the ſecret of their owne Soule: <hi>I am maried, I am attended on with a great trayne and charge of Children: My temporall Meanes lye only in my poſseſsing of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, and other Eccleſiaſticall Liuings, which are allotted to me for my Miniſteriall and Proteſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call functien: Yf Protestancy should ſuffer an vtter diſparition, and vanishing out of the World, What then would become of me? How should I, my Wyfe, and my poore Children maintayne our ſelues? We cannot liue only vpon breathing the Ayre: Therefore I muſt (nay I will) in all eſtuation and heate of diſpute and writing maintayne my owne Religion of Proteſtancy; shaping (though I grant, in a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade manner) the pretended ſenſe of the Scripture, to the fortifying of my lately appearing Fayth not my Fayth, to the true ſenſe of the Scripture. God is mercifull, and I hope (ſeing my state otherwyſe lyes mortally a bleeding) he will pardon this my Offence, proceeding from ſuch a forced and vrging Neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> O moſt dangerous, and deſperate Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>
